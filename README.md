# unevenprecip
Python code to diagnose the unevenness of precipitation

This script diagnoses the unevenness of precipitation according to the number of heaviest days of precipitation per year it takes to get half of total precipitation ([Pendergrass and Knutti 2018](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL080298)). 

As an example, the method is applied to TRMM 3b42 data, as available from FROGS ([Roca et al 2019](https://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/11/1017/2019/) - [data](https://doi.org/10.14768/06337394-73A9-407C-9997-0E380DAC5598)).
